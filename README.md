# MagGeoCoder

~~**TODO**: Test Maps API vs Place Geocode API~~ Removed

~~**TODO**: Order results~~

~~**TODO**: Reverse Geocode~~

~~**TODO**: Show result pins on map from acquired lat/lons~~

~~**TODO**: Warn users if \n entries or if subsdistricts exist~~ \n warnings no longer necessary, so this feature just for subdisctricts is kinda superfluous.

**TODO**: Possibly store/cache results in browser?

**TODO**: Zoom map to perfectly fit all markers.

**TODO**: Add form of exponential decay to requests (at one instance, in a 447 address query, 8 returned with a status as OVER QUERY LIMIT)
